    "The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data\n",
    "(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality\n",
    "between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model\n",
    "these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the\n",
