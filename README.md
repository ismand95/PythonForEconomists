# PythonForEconomists

Interact and run this repository in live Jupyter Notebooks using Binder:

### Goal of this project

This notebook is a part of my personal portfolio and is meant as a guide/tutorial to complete lots of different computing tasks _(usually encountered within economics, statistics or finance)_ using Python.

These examples can of course be done using proprietary systems like Stata or MATLAB _(or open-source packages like R)_, but as Python is emerging within data-science, is free, fun and easy to program, I personally think it is a superior choice in many instances within the aforementioned subjects.


### Current status

This is very much a work-in-progress and will probably never be fully complete - however it is always a fun learning experience to create resources for learning and development.


### Project structure

I will try to do as much work as possible in Jupyter Notebooks _(as I believe these are intuitive, easily distributable and have great graphical abilities)_. The folder "Notebooks" will contain subfolders of different overall subjects (econometrics etc.). Under these subfolders, there'll be 1 notebook per 1 subject. Example of this is one notebook for Simple Linear Regression in Econometrics. 

I will try to use open data-sources and fetch data over the internet, as one only needs to download the Jupyter notebook to be able to run the code and have everything execute properly.


### Requirements

This collection of examples expects some programming knowledge and a working setup. This includes (but not limited to):

* Working Python 3 installation
* Working JupyterLab installation
* Misc. packages installed - these will (among others) be
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Scipy
    * Matplotlib
    * etc.

For guides on how to install this see the following [link](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) or read documentation for the aforementioned packages.
