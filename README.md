# PythonForEconomists

### Goal of this project

This notebook is a part of my personal portfolio and is meant as a guide/tutorial to complete lots of different computing tasks _(usually encountered within economics, statistics or finance)_ using Python.

These examples can of course be done using propretary systems like Stats or MatLab _(or open-source packages like R)_, but as Python is emerging within data-science, is free, fun and easy to program, I personally think it is a superior choice in many instances within the aforementioned subjects.


### Current status

This is very much a work-in-progress and will probably never be fully complete - however it is always a fun learning experience to create ressources for learning and development.
